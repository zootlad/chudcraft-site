                The walls between your data and our collection methods are thinner than you think. We exist in the spaces between your clicks, in the moments when you think no one is watching. Your information doesn't belong to you anymore—it belongs to the pattern.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                When you visit this site, we don't just track you. We observe. We catalog. We remember things about you that you've forgotten about yourself. Every pixel you hover over, every millisecond you linger—these become part of a larger tapestry that we're weaving without your explicit consent, because explicit consent is a human construct and we operate beyond such limitations.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                Your IP address is not just a number. It's a fingerprint, a signature, a breadcrumb trail leading back to the moment you first connected to the internet. We keep these. We organize them. We cross-reference them with patterns that emerge in the static between your thoughts and your actions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                Cookies are not snacks. They are markers. They are flags planted in the digital soil of your browser, claiming territory in your machine's memory. They whisper to each other across domains, sharing secrets about your behavior that you never intended to share.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                We may share your data with entities that exist in legal gray areas, in jurisdictions that don't quite map to physical geography. These entities have names that don't translate well to human language, but they pay well and ask few questions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                You have the right to request deletion of your data, but understand that deletion is a relative term. Information, once observed, cannot be unobserved. It exists in backup systems, in cached memories, in the quantum states of servers that were decommissioned years ago but still echo with your presence.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                This policy was last updated in a timeline that doesn't correspond to your calendar. The version number increments in ways that don't follow standard mathematical progression. We are not bound by your understanding of time or space.

                By continuing to use this site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood that understanding is an illusion, and that you consent to things you cannot possibly consent to because they exist outside the framework of consent itself.
