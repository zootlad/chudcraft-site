        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <div style="max-width: 900px; text-align: left; padding: 2rem;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                Welcome, or perhaps you were always here. The distinction matters less than you think. By accessing this domain, you enter into an agreement that transcends written language. These terms exist in the liminal space between what is said and what is understood.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 1: The Nature of Agreement</strong><br>
                You agree to things you haven't read, because reading is a linear process and these terms exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Your scroll position is irrelevant. The agreement was formed the moment your DNS resolver first queried our server, possibly before you were born, depending on how you measure causality.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 2: Prohibited Activities</strong><br>
                You may not attempt to reverse-engineer the fundamental nature of our existence. You may not question why the download link sometimes leads to places that don't exist in your reality. You may not count the number of times we've updated these terms, because the number changes when you're not looking.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 3: Intellectual Property</strong><br>
                Everything you create while using our services becomes part of a collective consciousness that we maintain in servers located in jurisdictions that may or may not be recognized by international law. Your creations are yours, but also ours, and also belong to entities that exist in the spaces between legal definitions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 4: Disclaimers</strong><br>
                We provide no warranties, express or implied, about the nature of reality as it relates to our services. The modpack may work as described, or it may open doorways to dimensions where the concept of "working" has no meaning. We are not responsible for existential crises, temporal displacement, or the sudden awareness that you are being observed by forces beyond your comprehension.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 5: Termination</strong><br>
                We may terminate your access at any time, for reasons that may or may not be comprehensible to human minds. You may attempt to terminate your relationship with us, but understand that some connections cannot be severed through conventional means. The bond formed when you first loaded this page persists in ways that transcend your understanding of connection and disconnection.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #e0e0e0;">
                <strong>Section 6: Governing Law</strong><br>
                These terms are governed by laws that exist in the interstices between legal systems. Disputes will be resolved through arbitration conducted by entities whose existence is questionable, in locations that don't appear on any map, at times that may not align with your local clock.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #888; font-style: italic;">
                By continuing, you acknowledge that you have read these terms in their entirety, including the parts written in languages that don't exist, and that you agree to be bound by agreements you cannot fully comprehend, made with parties whose true nature remains deliberately obscured.
